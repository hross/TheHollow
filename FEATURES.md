# Current Features

### Adding Characters

You can add characters by copying and/or modifying the files in the __Assets/Characters/Christie directory. If you run the game out of the box, an additional character named Christie. Sprite sheets and character definitions are located in the TheHollow.Launcher/__Assets/Characters folder.

### New Menu Options

You can add menu options by modifying the InGameScreenHook.cs file.

### Kill Enemy Key

The Game1Hook.cs file adds an option for targeting any enemy with the targeting reticle and pushing the + key. This will instantly kill the targeted enemy (without costing an action).

### Debug Mode Launch

By default the game launches in debug mode, which allows pushing the Alt+[number] keys for any number of interesting built in debugging options.
